            we are dedicated to catching swearing and bad faith texts but that
            feels limiting. we strive to be used in a way that can be used by
            professionals and the average tweeter.<br />
            we went out to build something professionals could use in stressful
            work sessions. Imagine you need to let your coworker know you got
            the update, fast, but you're working on a hard problem you need to
            keep your attention on. A response you think is neutral to your
            coworker can easily sound snappy.<br />
            Maybe your a rally coordinator and you're genuinely excited about
            this new rally, but being out all day has drained you emotionally
            and everything sounds flat and unappreciative.<br />
            For Twitter specifically: we see a lot of us trying to make
            professional personas on there, and build friendly connections. So
            we thought of such a predictor could be used to try to craft a
            particular score range each time and keep a consistent mood with
            your coworkers or audience.
